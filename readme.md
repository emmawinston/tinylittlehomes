A very simple Tracery script meant for running on Cheap Bots Done Quick. Running [here](http://twitter.com/tinylittlehomes).

Source also available [here](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/tinylittlehomes).

This approximately works in Chrome and on the Twitter iOS app (though expanded view is broken in iOS). If it's broken on your platform, and/or you know anything about Unicode whitespace, get in touch.
